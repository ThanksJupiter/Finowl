  introTexts:
  - Dear sister,
  - When you read this letter, I will have left. I think I have found a way to stop
    the corrupting fog once and for all.
  - "I have followed the rumours and I think I\u2019ve found the source. I\u2019m
    not sure I will come back, but I hope I will succeed in my quest."
  - "I took the cart, I\x19'm sorry. I didn'\x19t want you to follow me. Hopefully,
    you will get to once again experience a healthy world."
  - From your sister, Nyctea
